    I value having flexibility in life that allows me to say yes to opportunities while keeping my physical & mental health in tack.

    <img src="./Assets/learn-how-to-learn.png" alt="Learn how to learn" style="width: 70%">


    I'm not British, so the whole system is new to me when I enter, but I soon developed a love for it. The whole "you only need 40 to pass, you learn everything provided to get 70, you do extra to get 70+" thing amazed me.
