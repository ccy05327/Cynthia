## FAQs

### What's your reason of choosing the degree?

- There are a few, but the top one is:

    ![Flexibility](./Assets/flexibility.png)

    I value having flexibility in life that allows me to say yes to opportunities while keeping my physical & mental health in tack. 

### What do you like the most about the degree?

- Same answer above, plus this:

    ![Learn how to learn](./Assets/learn-how-to-learn.png)

    I'm not British, so the whole system is new to me when I enter, but I soon developed a love for it. The whole "you only need 40 to pass, you learn everything provided to get 70, you do extra to get 70+" thing amazed me.
